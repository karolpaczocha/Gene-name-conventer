# Gene-name-conventer
After unscucessfuly searching online for a probe id to gene name conventer I took up the challange to set up my own one.

This code is written in R and used the bio conductor package:
https://www.bioconductor.org/install/ 
It is required to be used,
data.table package is not being used in this version of the code but for clarity it is listed at the top

The process can be run line by line, it produces a definded search stracture to change all the elements of the querry.
For bioinformatics studnets: feel free to use as an example however depending on what gene sets you use it might not work, follow the commented steps and it should work just fine :D
